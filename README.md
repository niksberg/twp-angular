TimeLine:
March 27: Assigned with the Project;
April 3: Restarted Project with Angular Framework;
April 24: Completed Home Page;
April 28: Completed About Page;
May 30: Planed to Complete the Project But, Got Stuck with Academic Assignments and College Work.
May 9:  Completed Service Page and Project;

Please Note: In the Service Page I have used direct SVG images (GoodWill Component and Counter), rather developing these complete static component. If required would definitely build it as per the requirements. But as time constraint have utilized SVG images.

This project was developed on the Angular v19 Framework using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
